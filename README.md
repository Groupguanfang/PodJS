# PodJS

PodJS is a watch-first host layer for PocketJS. One bundled Solid TSX app runs
inside the PocketJS QuickJS guest and targets four native watch shells:

- `android-watch` — Android 11/API 30+, Vulkan 1.1, ARMv7 and ARM64
- `wearos-watch` — Wear OS API 30+, Vulkan 1.1
- `watchos-watch` — watchOS 11+, WatchKit/SpriteKit
- `harmonyos-watch` — HarmonyOS 6.1 smart wearable, ArkUI/XComponent/GLES3

The checked-in target profiles and gallery use 240×240 as their portable design
baseline. At runtime each native host derives its logical render surface from
the physical display and raster density, then reports the resulting dimensions,
shape and safe insets through `@podjs/framework`. Application code adapts from
those metrics and capabilities, never target names.

The production runtime evaluates only the JS and pak embedded in the signed
application package. Debug deployment may replace those assets over ADB or HDC.

## Bootstrap

```sh
bun install
bun run doctor
bun test
cargo test --workspace
```

Build and package a target with the checked-in CLI:

```sh
bun run pod build --target=android-watch
bun run pod package --target=android-watch
```

Android packaging emits an ARMv7/ARM64 debug APK, release AAB and reusable
AAR. Wear OS uses the same runtime/AAR with a separate manifest and rotary
shell. watchOS packaging is run on the configured Xcode 16+ Mac; use
`scripts/build-watchos-runtime.sh` to build the device/simulator XCFramework
and its Swift Package release archive. The checked-in `PodJSWatchApp.xcodeproj`
produces the standalone, Watch-only application bundle. On a Windows
DevEco host, `pod package --target=harmonyos-watch` uses the checked-in
PowerShell script to cross-build Rust/QuickJS, embed the bundle assets and emit
an unsigned HAP.

## Implemented baseline

- Pinned PocketJS submodule, Solid TSX compiler path and four target profiles.
- Graphics-independent Rust/QuickJS runtime with a versioned C ABI, 60 Hz
  frame transaction, touch/rotary/lifecycle/theme delivery, HTTP host commands,
  bounded per-app KV/files, demand rendering and resource revisions.
- Fail-closed package manifest validation before JavaScript execution. Target,
  host ABI, capability list, PocketJS revision and bundle/pak hashes are checked.
- Android/Wear AAR/JNI with dual ARM ABIs, API 30-compatible asset loading,
  lifecycle/surface recovery, haptics/network bridge and Vulkan 1.1 swapchain.
- watchOS Swift Package/SpriteKit host validated with a linked Rust/QuickJS
  XCFramework on an Apple Watch simulator and with signed startup plus a static
  rendered frame on a physical Series 9. Touch and Digital Crown bridging and
  UI tests are present; physical interaction remains a separate acceptance gate.
- HarmonyOS Stage/XComponent/N-API/GLES3 source tree validated by its native
  build host.
- A 1,000-row Solid component/performance gallery and contract tests.

The Android renderer incrementally rasterizes the canonical DrawList at density
2, uploads only changed frames and scales them into the Vulkan swapchain. This preserves
font atlases, textures, triangles, gradients, alpha and clipping while keeping
presentation and surface recovery native. Direct per-operation Vulkan pipelines
remain optional performance work rather than a visual-correctness dependency.

See [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the runtime and host contract.
